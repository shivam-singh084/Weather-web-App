# TODO List for Weather App Card Updates

- [x] Edit infoBox.jsx: Increase Card maxWidth from 500 to 700, change background to semi-transparent blue 'rgba(135, 206, 235, 0.8)' to match the sky background image.
- [ ] Fix card width: Change from maxWidth to width: 700 to ensure the card is actually 700px wide.
- [ ] Run the app to verify changes and ensure the card is wider and color blends with the background.
